## üìò Notes

- Both B√©zier and Laval nozzle geometries were tested under equivalent boundary conditions and mesh densities (~450‚Äì500k cells) and same iterations.
- Goal: Understand the effect of nozzle geometry on **choked flow**, **shock patterns**, and **wall forces**.

## üìä Results & Observations

- **Shock Behavior:**  
  In the B√©zier nozzle, shock transitions appear more **diffused and less abrupt** compared to the De Laval nozzle. This is likely due to the **curved, smooth wall profile**, which allows pressure gradients to distribute more gradually.  
  In contrast, the Laval nozzle‚Äîwith its sharper geometric transitions‚Äîproduces **more distinct shock patterns** and flow separation zones.

- **Wall Force Comparison:**  
  Due to its geometry, the B√©zier nozzle produced a **lower wall force (270 N)** than the Laval nozzle under the same inlet and outlet conditions. This can be attributed to **gentler flow acceleration and deceleration**, reducing the net force acting on the walls.

- **Mass Flow Balance:**  
  The B√©zier nozzle exhibited a **smaller difference between inlet and outlet mass flow rates**, which indicates **a more stable and efficient flow pattern** in numerical terms.  
  This also implies that **convergence was smoother**, and numerical diffusion or recirculation effects were minimized.

> These results suggest that while the De Laval nozzle offers stronger thrust potential due to higher wall forces, the B√©zier nozzle provides smoother flow characteristics with potentially lower noise, shock intensity, and computational cost.
